# Simple-calculator

An on-screen calculator was created Javascript as the backend and HTML and CSS as the frontend. It can perform basic math functions (+, -, *, /). Normal calculations usually consist of a number followed by an operator followed by another number. However, if the second number is not pressed, the second number automatically defaults to equal the first number. Additionally, if a calculation is performed (and the result displayed), and the user presses the equal button again, the previous operation will be performed on the result.

The UI was designed to make the calculator easier for users to use. In particular, when a user presses an operator button, the button becomes shaded to allow users to visually see what operator they pressed. If they press a new operator button, the new button will be shaded while the previously pressed one will become unshaded. 

The calculator can be viewed on the deployment page.
